# Basic Concepts

Here are some links to LP modelling concepts **and how they operate in lp_solve** in lp_solve's own documentation.

- [integer variables](https://lp-solve.github.io/integer.htm)
- [semi-continuous variables](https://lp-solve.github.io/semi-cont.htm)
- [free variables](https://lp-solve.github.io/free.htm)
- [special ordered sets](https://lp-solve.github.io/SOS.htm)
- [ratio's](https://lp-solve.github.io/ratio.htm)
- [absolute values](https://lp-solve.github.io/absolute.htm)
- [scaling](https://lp-solve.github.io/scaling.htm)
- [sensitivity](https://lp-solve.github.io/sensitivity.htm)
- [Presolve](https://lp-solve.github.io/Presolve.htm)
- [Infeasible models](https://lp-solve.github.io/Infeasible.htm)
- [Basis Factorization Packages](https://lp-solve.github.io/BFP.htm)
